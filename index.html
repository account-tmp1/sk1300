<p>Lithium Nevada LLC (“LN”) is advancing the Thacker Pass Project in Humboldt County, Nevada, (hereafter referred to as “the Project”), formerly known as the Lithium Nevada Project or Stage I of the Kings Valley Lithium Project. LN is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a joint venture between Lithium Americas Corp. (“LAC”), which has a 62% ownership, and General Motors Holdings LLC (“GM”), which has a 38% ownership. The terms “LN” and “LAC” are used throughout the report to denote the owners of the Project.</p>
<p>The Property, defined in <a class="reference internal" href="#s-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">Section 1.2</span></a>, encompasses the mineral claims that were formerly referred to as the Stage I area of the Kings Valley Lithium Project and includes lithium (Li) claystone mining at the Thacker Pass deposit. The Project is currently in the development stage with pre-construction activities well advanced. This Technical Report Summary (“TRS”) presents the results of a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) evaluation of the Thacker Pass Project.</p>
<p>SGS Canada Inc. was commissioned by LAC to prepare this TRS. In preparing this report, SGS relied upon input from LAC and information prepared by several qualified independent consulting groups particularly regarding geology, geological mapping, exploration, and resource estimation. See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#s-2"><span class="std std-ref">Section 2</span></a> for a full discussion of contributors to this study.</p>
<p>The economic analysis is based on second quarter 2024 pricing for capital and operating costs.</p>

<span id="s-1-2"></span><h3>1.2 Property Location, Description and Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#property-location-description-and-ownership" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>LAC currently has surface and mineral rights within the Thacker Pass Project and to the northwest of the Thacker Pass Project area in the Montana Mountains. The Thacker Pass Project area encompasses approximately 7,900 ha within the total LAC property of approximately 22,500 ha. The Thacker Pass Project is located in Humboldt County in northern Nevada, approximately 100 km north-northwest of Winnemucca, approximately 33 km west-northwest of Orovada, Nevada, and 33 km due south of the Oregon border. It is situated within Township 44 North (T44N), Range 34 East (R34E), and within portions of Sections 1 and 12; T44N, R35E within portions of Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17; and T44N, R36E within portions of Sections 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 29.</p>
<p>Chevron began an exploration program for uranium in the sediments located throughout the McDermitt Caldera in 1975 and added lithium to its assays in 1978 and 1979 after discovering anomalous concentrations of lithium associated with the caldera. From 1980 to 1987, Chevron began a drilling program that focused on lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the clays to determine the viability of lithium extraction. In 1991, Chevron sold its interest in the claims to Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation who allowed the claims to lapse. Jim LaBret, one of Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation claim owner, leased his claims in 2005 to WEDC. In 2007, WEDC leased the mining claims to WLC for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation. WLC changed its name to Lithium Americas Corp. in 2016. Section 5 of this TRS further describes the history of the Project in further details.</p>
<p>No prior commercial lithium production has occurred on the Property.</p>

<section id="geology">
<span id="s-1-3"></span><h3>1.3 Geology<a class="headerlink" href="#geology" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Project is located within an extinct 40x30 km supervolcano named McDermitt Caldera, which was formed approximately 16.3 million years ago (Ma) as part of a hotspot currently underneath the Yellowstone Plateau. Following an initial eruption and concurrent collapse of the McDermitt Caldera, a large lake formed in the caldera basin. This lake water was extremely enriched in lithium and resulted in the accumulation of lithium-rich clays.</p>
<p>Late volcanic activity uplifted the caldera, draining the lake and bringing the lithium-rich moat sediments to the surface resulting in the near-surface lithium deposit which is the subject of the Project.</p>
<p>The Thacker Pass deposit sits sub-horizontally beneath a thin alluvial cover and is partially exposed at the surface. The sedimentary section consists of alternating layers of claystone and volcanic ash. Basaltic lavas occur intermittently within the sedimentary sequence. The moat sedimentary section at the Project site overlies the indurated intra-caldera Tuff of Long Ridge. A zone of silicified sedimentary rock, the Hot Pond Zone (HPZ), occurs at the base of the sedimentary section above the Tuff of Long Ridge.</p>
<p>Clay in the Thacker Pass deposit includes two distinct types of clay mineral, smectite and illite. Smectite clay occurs at relatively shallow depths in the deposit and contain roughly 2,000 - 4,000 parts per million (ppm) lithium. Higher lithium contents (commonly 4,000 ppm lithium or greater) are typical for illite clay which occurs at relatively moderate to deep depths and contain values approaching 9,000 ppm lithium in terms of whole-rock assay.</p>
</section>
<section id="deposit-types">
<span id="s-1-4"></span><h3>1.4 Deposit Types<a class="headerlink" href="#deposit-types" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Lithium enrichment (greater than 1,000 ppm) in the Thacker Pass deposit and deposits of the Montana Mountains occur throughout the caldera lake sedimentary sequence above the intra-caldera Tuff of Long Ridge. The exact cause for the lithium enrichment in the caldera lake sediments is still up for debate. The presence of sedimentary carbonate minerals and magnesium-smectite (hectorite) throughout the lake indicates that the clays formed in a basic, alkaline, closed hydrologic system.</p>
<p>It is likely that two primary mechanisms play a role in the genesis of the Thacker Pass deposit: (1) neoformation of smectite in a closed lake, rich in lithium due to the leaching of nearby and underlying volcanic glass (Benson et al., 2017b); and (2) alteration of a portion of the smectite-bearing clays to illite during intracaldera hydrothermal alteration associated with the uplift of the Montana Mountains.</p>
<p>Caldera lake sediments of the McDermitt Caldera contain elevated lithium concentrations compared to other sedimentary basins. Exploration results support the proposed model and have advanced the understanding of the geology of the Thacker Pass deposit.</p>
</section>
<section id="exploration">
<span id="s-1-5"></span><h3>1.5 Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#exploration" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Exploration programs have been carried out in the McDermitt Caldera since 1975, including the drilling campaigns identified in Section 1.6. A collar survey was completed by LAC for the 2007-2008 drilling program using a Trimble GPS (Global Positioning System). The topographic surface of the Project area was mapped by aerial photography dated July 6, 2010, by MXS, Inc. for LAC using Trimble equipment for ground control. In addition to drilling in 2017, LAC conducted five seismic survey lines along a series of historical drill holes to test the survey method’s accuracy and resolution in identifying clay interfaces.</p>
<p>A geophysical investigation of the subsurface materials was performed in 2023 using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Towed Transient Electromagnetic (tTEM) survey methods to map the basalt, alluvium, basement depth, delineate potential faults and differentiate between illite and smectite clays. Further regional mapping of the Caldera has been conducted by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and used to outline the caldera moat sediments. Further work was undertaken with federal labs and universities to refine the geology and improve the genetic model of the Thacker Pass deposit.</p>

<section id="drilling">
<span id="s-1-6"></span><h3>1.6 Drilling<a class="headerlink" href="#drilling" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Thacker Pass deposit area has been explored for minerals since the 1970s by different companies and drilling campaigns. <a class="reference internal" href="#tbl-1-1"><span class="std std-ref">Table 1-1</span></a> categorizes the different drilling campaigns of LAC, including the number of holes drilled, and type of drilling utilized. Drilling methods were compared to test for sample bias, using core drilling as the standard. Rotary, sonic, and reverse circulation drilling all showed slight sample biases when compared to core drilling. Only HQ core holes were used for resource modeling to minimize the chance of sample bias. The drilling techniques, core recovery, and sample collection procedures provided results that are suitable for use in resource estimation. There are no drilling, sample, or recovery factors that materially impact the accuracy and reliability of results. The data is adequate for use in resource estimation.</p>

<p>The drilled core was securely placed in core boxes and labelled at site. The boxes of drilled core were then transported to the secure LAC logging and sampling facility in Orovada, Nevada, where they were lithologically logged, photographed, cut, and sampled by LAC employees and contractors under LAC supervision. The samples were either picked up by ALS Global (ALS) by truck or delivered to ALS in Reno, Nevada by LAC employees. ALS is independent of LAC.</p>
<p>Once at ALS, the samples were dried at a maximum temperature of 60oC. The entire sample was then crushed with a jaw crusher to 90% passing a 10-mesh screen. LAC used ALS Global’s standard ME-MS61 analytical package for all of the samples collected which provides analytical results for 48 elements, including lithium. Certified analytical results were reported on the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) determinations.</p>
<p>Blank samples were used to check for cross-contamination between samples at the lab. Standard samples consisting of a 3,000 ppm and 4,000 ppm grade lithium bearing claystone from the Project area and a commercial 1,000 ppm lithium standard were used to test the accuracy and precision of the analytical methods used at the lab. Duplicate samples are used to check the precision of the analytical methods of the lab and were taken every 30.5 m of core (i.e., they were collected downhole every 100 ft).</p>

<p>Certified laboratory certificates of assays were provided in pdf (Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format) as well as comma separated value (csv) formatted files for verification of the sample assays database. Sample names, certificate identifications, and run identifications were cross referenced with the laboratory certificates and sample assay datasheet for spot checking and verification of data. No data anomalies were discovered during this check.</p>
<p>Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) methodology utilized by LAC and results of these checks were discussed between LAC geologists and the QP responsible for Section 9 of the TRS.</p>
<p>Geologic logs, Access databases, and Excel spreadsheets were provided to the QP for cross validation with the Excel lithological description file. Spot checks between Excel lithological description sheets were performed against the source data with no inconsistencies found with the geologic unit descriptions.</p>
<p>Verification of the block model was performed by the creation of a geostatistical model and the review of its various outputs. Histograms, simulation, and swath plots were created and analyzed to validate the accuracy of the block model.</p>
<p>Based on the various reviews, validation exercises and remedies outlined above, the Mineral Resources QP concluded that the data is adequate for use for resource estimation.</p>

<span id="s-1-9"></span><h3>1.9 Metallurgical Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#metallurgical-testing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Extensive metallurgical and process development testing has been performed both internally at LAC’s Lithium Technical Development Center (“LiTDC”) and externally with vendors and contract commercial research organizations. Data collected from test programs has been used for flowsheet development, various equipment selection, definition of operating parameters and development of process design criteria. The relevant metallurgical test data and results are summarized and discussed in Section 10.</p>
<p>Metallurgical and process development test work was completed and optimized to recover lithium from ore and produce battery grade lithium carbonate. The ore samples used for all metallurgical testing were collected from material within the proposed mining pit at the Thacker Pass deposit. The samples spatially represent the ore body, with material collected from both undisturbed upper smectite horizons and uplifted faulted blocks that represent deeper illite horizons. The metallurgical performance and chemical processes contribute to lithium losses in the plant. Design criteria recoveries range from 74.6% to 86.8% and average 80.6% based on ore mineralization and process chemistries. The five major areas contributing to lithium losses in the process plant include beneficiation, leaching and neutralization, countercurrent decantation (CCD) and filtration circuit, magnesium and calcium removal (i.e., purification) and lithium carbonate production.</p>
<p>Summary of test work from the key areas are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Attrition Scrubbing</strong>: test work has demonstrated that attrition scrubbing is effective to liberate lithium containing clays from coarse gangue material. A two-stage scrubbing circuit is used for the process design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Classification</strong>: conventional hydrocyclones followed by hydraulic classifiers are used to separate clay from gangue mineralization. Coarse gangue mass is estimated to align with estimated pit ash content (approximately 42% of total mass). Based on bench tests and pilot scale testing, approximately 92% of lithium contained in Run-of-Mine (ROM) is projected to be recovered to the lithium bearing clay slurry at a separation size of approximately 75 um.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solid-Liquid Separation (Thickening and Dewatering)</strong>: clay slurry will be dewatered in two stages, a high-rate thickener to achieve approximately 25% to 35% solids by mass followed by decanter centrifuges to generate a discharge slurry of approximately 55% solids by mass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leaching</strong>: an acid dose of 490 kilograms (kg) sulfuric acid per tonne leach feed solids provided the maximum amount of lithium extracted/unit acid from smectite and illite clay types.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neutralization</strong>: ground limestone and recycled solids from the magnesium precipitation circuit have proven effective to neutralize any residual acid in the leached slurry. Limestone reagent efficiency from nearby sources has been confirmed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neutralized Slurry Filtration</strong>: solid/liquid separation of neutralized slurry is achieved in an eight-stage CCD coupled with plate and frame filter press circuit. The filter cake is not washed. The filtrate recovered is directed back to the CCD circuit to wash the leached residue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnesium and Calcium Removal</strong>: tests have demonstrated that about 75% of magnesium in neutralized brine can be removed via crystallization, and the remainder is treated by addition of milk-of-lime in the magnesium precipitation circuit. Calcium is then removed by precipitation with sodium carbonate, and a final ion exchange (IX) step is used to polish the brine and bring divalent ions and boron concentrations down to trace levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lithium Carbonate Production</strong>: a three-stage circuit for lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) production is necessary to achieve battery-quality product. Crystals produced had little to no agglomerates present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) crystallization</strong>: it has been demonstrated that sodium and potassium are removed as sulfate salts in a ZLD crystallization system without crystallization of lithium sulfate. Refinement and further optimization of the process continues at the LiTDC.</p></li>

<span id="id2"></span><h4>1.10.2 Mineral Reserves<a class="headerlink" href="#s-1-10-2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The Mineral Reserves estimate for the Thacker Pass deposit are based on an engineered pit shell developed from the December 31, 2024 Mineral Resources. The Mineral Reserves are a modified subset of the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. A variable cutoff grade of LCE recovered per tonne of leach ore feed to provide 40,000 LCE tonnes per plant. The mine plan resulted in an 85-year mine life with a ROM total plant feed of 1,056.7 million dry tonnes.</p>
<p>Overall reserve ore and waste tonnages are modeled using Maptek’s geologic software package. Waste consists of various types of material, including basalt, volcanic ash, alluvium, and clay that does not meet the ore definition, or the cutoff grade described above.</p>
<p>The classified Mineral Reserves are summarized in <a class="reference internal" href="#tbl-1-3"><span class="std std-ref">Table 1-3</span></a> for the 85-year pit. This estimate uses a maximum ash percent cutoff of 85% and a cutoff grade of 13.3 kg of LCE recovered per tonne of leach ore feed. For this analysis, the QP responsible for Section 12 of the TRS has assumed that there will be a 2.5% loss on the top and bottom of the ore zones (5% total) in an effort to clean the contact zones between domains. This analysis has not considered adding dilution into the mine plan due to the loss that is being applied. As the Thacker Pass deposit is further domained into smaller zones, the QP recommends reevaluating the need for dilution to be applied to the contact zones.</p>

<span id="s-1-11"></span><h3>1.11 Mining Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#mining-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The mining method chosen for the 85-year life of mine will use hydraulic excavators loading a fleet of end dump trucks. The fleet will be used for all material excavation and haulage. The material hauled includes ore, waste, and coarse gangue. The coarse gangue is an oversized material removed after the ore is mixed with water. The excavators and trucks will increase in bucket size and bed size as phases are added,</p>
<p>Mining and material handling will be contracted through Sawtooth Mining, LLC (Sawtooth), a subsidiary of NACCO Natural Resources Corporation (NACCO). A mine plan has been developed to maximize recovered lithium carbonate over the life of mine.</p>
<p>The mine design and mine plan are based on the economic pit shell with four plants at a leach ore feed rate to provide 40,000 LCE tonnes per plant. The truck and excavation fleet will develop several offset benches to maintain a geotechnically stable highwall slope. The bench heights are designed to enable the mine to have multiple grades of ore exposed at any given time, allowing flexibility to deliver different types and grades of ore to be blended as needed to target a cutoff grade of a minimum of 7.5 kg of LCE recovered per tonne of leach ore feed and a maximum of 26 kg LCE recovered per tonne of leach ore feed.</p>
<p>The annual production rate is based on varying ore feed rates determined by providing a higher economic return during the high capital intensity years of plant building and the availability of sulfuric acid for the leaching process. The following is a summary of the 85-year life of mine production:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>7,722 million total wet tonnes mined which includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1,219 million wet tonnes of recovered ore (95% ore recovery assumed)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>958 million wet tonnes in situ ore to plant</p></li>
<li><p>261 million wet stockpiled ore tonnes to plant</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>6,503 million wet tonnes of total waste (includes growth media)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>13.0 million wet tonnes of waste rehandle</p></li>
<li><p>Strip ratio 5.3:1 (total waste : recovered ore) on a wet tonnage basis</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-production period of four years.</p></li>
<li><p>Mining approximately 14.3 Mt of LCE with 11.5 Mt of lithium carbonate recovered by the process plant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first four years, the mine waste will primarily be hauled to the out-of-pit waste storage area. After four years, some of the mine waste can be dumped back in-pit but will also continue to be hauled out of pit. Ore will be hauled to a run-of-mine stockpile located to the northwest of the process plant area. The attrition scrubber reject material will be hauled to the out-of-pit waste stockpile or back into the empty pit by year 20 per the plan.</p>
</section>
<section id="recovery-methods">
<span id="s-1-12"></span><h3>1.12 Recovery Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#recovery-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The current process flowsheet, material balance, and process design criteria for the Project are developed from metallurgical test work and a steady-state process model built in Aspen(r) Plus (Aspen) software. Design criteria, major equipment, reagent and utility consumptions, mine plan values, and overall recovery estimates used for lithium carbonate production forecasts provide the basis for the Project economic model. The process flow sheet consists of five key areas: beneficiation, leaching and neutralization, CCD and filtration circuit, magnesium and calcium removal (i.e., purification) and lithium carbonate production. In beneficiation, the lithium concentration of ore is upgraded with the rejection of coarse gangue and retention of clay ore. The upgraded ore slurry is then processed in a leach circuit using sulfuric acid to extract the lithium from the lithium-bearing clay. The lithium-bearing solution is then purified primarily by using crystallizers and precipitation reagents to produce battery grade lithium carbonate. Leach residue is washed, filtered, and stacked in a tailing facility along with various salts generated in the process.</p>
<p>Waste products include coarse gangue from beneficiation, neutralized leach residue filter cake, magnesium sulfate salts, and sodium/potassium sulfate salts. The filter cake and salts will be stacked in the clay tailings filter stack (“CTFS”) facility with coarse gangue placed in a dedicated facility and used as open pit backfill.</p>
<p>Recovery of lithium carbonate equivalent from ore mined and processed in this plan, to produce lithium carbonate, ranges from 75.2% to 83.7%. The weighted average recovery of lithium carbonate from lithium carbonate equivalent mined for the first 25 years and the 85-year life-of-mine plan is 82.1% and 80.4% respectively. The recovery ranges are realized from an average mined lithium grade of 2,538 ppm contained within an ore blend consisting of 96.6% illite and 3.4% smectite.</p>

Construction activities included a water supply system from the Quinn well area including two completed production wells, a pumping system to supply construction water, the primary raw water pipeline to support construction, Phase 1 and Phase 2 water demand, and a construction water pond to provide fresh water for construction activities. Plant pad earthwork construction also started along with the installation of construction offices, fuel storage, site entrances, among other basic site improvements in preparation for the overall execution of the Phase 1 Project.</p>
<p>A direct rail line to the Thacker Pass Project is included during the Phase 4 expansion. This rail system will allow for raw materials to be delivered directly to the Project and will reduce over-highway trucking.</p>
<p>At approximately 4 years and 40 years into the Project a portion of the SR293 and 115 kV transmission line will require relocation to allow for expansion of the CTFS initially and later for the open pit.</p>

<span id="s-1-13-1"></span><h4>1.13.1 Raw Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#raw-materials" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Raw materials for the Project are to be delivered to the site by over highway trucks during Phase 1 to 3. Approximately 41 truckloads per day will make raw material deliveries and lithium carbonate product transportation to and from the site during Phase 1, with Phases 2 and 3 scaling to 85 and 127 trucks per day, respectively. A local rail-to-truck transloading facility located in Winnemucca will allow for transfer of most of the bulk raw materials for delivery to the Project site during Phase 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>A direct rail line is included during the Phase 4 expansion. This will facilitate most raw materials to be railed directly to the Project site and the transloading facility in Winnemucca is assumed to cease operations. For the remaining life of mine an anticipated 51 trucks per day are expected as most raw materials will be direct railed to the site.</p>

<span id="s-1-13-2"></span><h4>1.13.2 Sulfuric Acid Plants<a class="headerlink" href="#sulfuric-acid-plants" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 will each have a single sulfuric acid plant capable of producing a nominal 2,250 t/d (100 weight % H2SO4 basis) of sulfuric acid by the double contact, double absorption process. Liquid sulfur is delivered, offloaded and stored onsite by truck during Phases 1 through 3 and delivered by rail thereafter for Phases 4 and 5. The Phase 5 sulfuric acid plant will be capable of producing a nominal 3,000 t/d sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid generated from each plant is stored and used in the process plant. The acid plants will also generate power for the processing plants. Additional power required will be purchased and delivered to site from the local power grid.</p>
</section>
<section id="stockpiles">
<span id="s-1-13-3"></span><h4>1.13.3 Stockpiles<a class="headerlink" href="#stockpiles" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Approximately 1,219.3 Mt of ore (wet) and 6,503.1 Mt of waste rock (wet) will be mined from the open pit over the LOM. In the initial years, the West and East Waste Rock Storage Facilities (WRSFs) will be constructed to store waste rock from the pit. Once the pit is established, concurrent backfill with waste rock and coarse gangue will be employed. Eventually, the pit footprint will extend to the West and East WRSFs at which point they will be excavated and placed back into the pit as pit backfill.</p>
<p>Coarse gangue is produced in the classification stage of the mineral processing unit operation and is conveyed into the Coarse Gangue Stockpile (CGS) after going through a dewatering process. Initially, the coarse gangue material will be placed in the CGS located east of the open pit. The CGS is designed to store about 36.9 Mm3 (48.3 Mcy) of material. As described above for the WRSFs, once the pit is established, concurrent backfill with waste rock and coarse gangue will be employed. Eventually, the pit footprint will extend to the CGS at which point the coarse gangue will be excavated and placed back into the pit as pit backfill.</p>

<section id="tailings">
<span id="s-1-13-4"></span><h4>1.13.4 Tailings<a class="headerlink" href="#tailings" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>A total quantity of 1.10 billion dry tonnes (1.12 billion cubic meters) of clay tailings plus salts require secure disposal on a lined facility. Clay Tailings Filter Stacks (CTFS 1 and CTFS 2) are designed to provide adequate storage over the life of mine. Phased expansions of these facilities are performed as needed over the life of mine.</p>
</section>
<section id="power">
<span id="s-1-13-5"></span><h4>1.13.5 Power<a class="headerlink" href="#power" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Total operating loads for Phase 1 through 4 is approximately 59 MW per phase and 44 MW for Phase 5. The total operating load is approximately 276 MW. Power will be generated at the sulfuric acid plants from the steam generated from excess heat during sulfuric acid production. The average power generation and import requirement is estimated to be 134 MW and 142 MW respectively with all phases operating.</p>
<p>Thacker Pass is located in the service territory of Harney Electric Cooperative (HEC). A 115 kV line passes through the site and will be relocated outside of the open pit extents during mining operations. Since the Nevada power market is regulated, LAC will purchase all imported power from HEC. HEC infrastructure to support this import load will require upgrading and is included in the CAPEX presented. HEC is a full requirements customer of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). BPA wheels power to HEC through NV Energy’s transmission system. BPA has power available to sell and any constraints on existing transmission infrastructure to deliver the power to the HEC system are being evaluated by NV Energy.</p>

<section id="water">
<span id="s-1-13-6"></span><h4>1.13.6 Water<a class="headerlink" href="#water" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Phases 1, 2, and 3 water demand for mining and process operations is approximately 3.5 Mm3 (2,850 acre-ft) per year per phase for a total of 10.6 Mm3 (8,550 acre-ft) per year, respectively. To support Phases 4 and 5 approximately 18.8 Mm3 (15,250 acre-ft) will be required. Water for Phases 1 and 2 will be supplied from two existing wells and raw water pipeline in the Quinn River Valley. LAC purchased and transferred the Phase 1 water rights to the water well location in 2023 and completed the pipeline installation to support Phase 1 and 2 demand. Phase 2 water rights have been partially secured. A well system and pipeline are included for Phase 3 and 4 with water being supplied from the four wells and two pipelines to support the LOM operations.</p>

<span id="s-1-14"></span><h3>1.14 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impacts<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-studies-permitting-and-social-or-community-impacts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Project received all major environmental permits and licenses for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Federal, State, and local permitting for the additional phases and ultimate LOM operations are required. The costs for baseline studies and permitting activities to support the execution strategy for future Phases 3, 4 and 5 are included in the financial model for this report.</p>
<p>Project operations will have a long-term positive impact to direct, indirect, and incidental local and regional economics and communities. Phase 1 will require total construction employment of approximately 2,000, including 1,800 skilled contractors, and operations will employ approximately 350 full time LN and Sawtooth employees. Future phases will see full time employees average near 1,100 personnel with additional jobs created in the local communities through ancillary and support services, such as transportation, maintenance, and supplies.</p>
<p>Lithium Americas continues to be involved in the local communities and for nearly five years LAC has met regularly and collaborated with the communities of Orovada, Winnemucca, Kings River, Fort McDermitt and the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe to build relationships, share information, address concerns, and identify areas where the company could have a positive impact on the local communities as the Project advances.</p>

<section id="market-studies">
<span id="s-1-15"></span><h3>1.15 Market Studies<a class="headerlink" href="#market-studies" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Pricing of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide corrected from an all-time high February 2023 of almost 80,000 $/t imported to China. These highs were disconnected from the production cost curve resulting in the development of very high-cost sources of lithium products including hard rock resources from new jurisdictions such as Africa. Recently pricing corrected to approximately $11,000/t, well below the cost of operation for lithium carbonate being produced, from market-purchased spodumene concentrate within China. The impact of this swing can be seen in the closure of spodumene and lepidolite assets in Canada, Australia and Africa and in the quarterly operating losses being reported by hard-rock based lithium carbonate producers.</p>
<p>Despite swings in realized pricing for lithium carbonate and closures of low-quality resources and chemical production from purchased lithium carbonate, the Chinese demand for LCE has grown by 29% in 2023, and an estimated further 13% in 2024 to a total of 686,745 t LCE. This Chinese demand represents nearly 70% of the 2024 forecasted total demand of lithium chemicals.</p>
<p>Consensus forecast demand is expected to grow to approximately 3,000,000 t LCE by 2030 to meet a 50% global electrification forecast by automotive manufacturers, governments and industry experts. (see Figure 16-1) To roughly triple the global demand and supply of lithium chemicals will require a 20% per year annual growth rate. The 2030 forecasted demand is approximately three times the 2024 estimated actual use of LCE.</p>
<p>Lithium carbonate pricing history has shown to be disconnected from the cost of production and this report is taking a conservative approach that pricing will remain at current incentive pricing long term if the vision of 100% electric vehicle penetration is to be realized. Incentive pricing is calculated based on justifying the capital investment required for a significant (40,000 t/y LCE basis) operation. Including the cost curve plus approximately $5,000/t required above the operating cost required estimates an incentive price of approximately $29,000/t LCE required. This study assumes a non-incentive price to be conservative.</p>
<p>The pricing forecast for lithium carbonate is based on market research and is set at $24,000 US$/t beginning year 1 of production. A +-25% sensitivity evaluation of the set price is used to evaluate the Project sensitivity to price.</p>

<p>An economic analysis was carried out using a discounted cashflow (DCF) model, which was prepared by LAC with input from SGS, NewFields, Sawtooth, Bechtel, and EXP U.S. Services Inc. (EXP). The final financial model used to generate results presented in this report was audited and managed by SGS, with reliance on third party firm experts and third party firm mining experts for individual components. Annual cashflow projections were estimated for eighty-five years based on the LOM plan, estimates of capital expenditures, production costs, taxes, royalties, and sales from lithium carbonate production. The only revenue stream is the sale of lithium carbonate. Inflation is not assumed in this model.</p>
<p>Thacker Pass Project Phase 1 investments since the first quarter 2023 are included in the financial model and economic analysis and depreciated on a 7-year modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) basis.</p>

<span id="s-1-18"></span><h3>1.18 Conclusions and Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions-and-recommendations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<section id="conclusions">
<span id="s-1-18-1"></span><h4>1.18.1 Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Based upon analysis, interpretation and results of exploration, engineering, and environmental permitting carried out for the Project the following conclusions have been made:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><ins>Mineral Resource Estimate</ins>: The mineralization is at surface and made up of a claystone and ash mix that can be free dug with minimal blasting while using conventional mining equipment. The Mineral Resource estimate for the Project was updated in 2024 to 277.1 Mt of Measured Resource averaging 2,180 ppm Li for 3.2 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent, 2,396.6 Mt of Indicated Resource averaging 2,060 ppm Li for 26.3 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent and 1,981.5 Mt of Inferred Resource averaging 2,070 ppm Li for 21.6 Mt lithium carbonate equivalent. This resulted in a 207% increase in tonnage and 238% more lithium carbonate equivalent when compared to the December 31, 2022 Technical Report. A cutoff grade of 858 ppm Li and an open pit shell were used to constrain the resource estimate based on break even economics.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Mineral Reserve Estimate</ins>: The Mineral Reserve estimate was estimated from an 85-year pit designed to satisfy ore delivery requirements. Mineral Reserves for the Project have been estimated with 269.5 Mt of Proven Reserves with an average grade of 3,180 ppm Li for 4.5 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent and 787.1 Mt of Probable Reserves with an average grade of 2,320 ppm Li for 9.7 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent. The total tonnage mined for the 85-year pit 1,056.7 Mt with an average grade of 2,540 ppm Li for 14.3 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Environmental Permits</ins>: All major permits and authorizations for Phase 1 have been achieved and there are no identified issues that would prevent LAC from achieving all permits and authorizations required to complete construction and operation of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 based on the data that has been collected to date. LAC understands that additional permits are required for Phases 3, 4 and 5 and understands the process and timing required to obtain these permits.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Metallurgical Processes</ins>: Metallurgical processes have been engineered and optimized from pilot testing, bench scale testing, and modeling to produce lithium carbonate using conventional unit operations arranged in a novel flowsheet. Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 production capacity are designed for a nominal 40,000 t/y each phase for a combined designed nominal capacity rate of approximately 160,000 t/y of lithium carbonate. Owing to a reduction in mining cut-off grade and resulting requirement for additional sulfuric acid, a fifth phase is added including mineral beneficiation through brine evaporation to produce brine to supplement the four purification stages from phases 1, 2, 3, and 4. Recovery of lithium during operations will fluctuate with varying ore mineralization and process chemistries. Illite ores recover better than smectite ores. The LOM lithium carbonate produced is 11.5 Mt from 14.3 Mt of LCE mined with an average recovery of 80.4%. The LOM ore feed contains an average 96.6% illite at an overall feed grade of 2,538 ppm lithium.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Infrastructure</ins>: Construction for the Phase 1 project started in 2023 and is expected to conclude in 2027. Future phased expansions include the addition of four acid plants and supporting facilities to mine and process lithium bearing ore to produce lithium carbonate and stockpiles to store waste and tailings.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Water and Power</ins>: Water rights and quantity required for construction and production during Phase 1 is secured, in the amount of 3.5 Mm3 (2,850 acre-ft) per year. Future water rights will be required in the amount of 3.5 Mm3 for Phases 2 and 3 each with an additional 8.3 Mm3 required to support Phases 4 and 5 through the LOM. Power demand in MW for Phases 1, 2, 3, 4 is approximately 59 and 44 for Phase 5.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Capital Requirements</ins>: Capital costs are based primarily on Q1-4 2024 pricing and meet the accuracy and contingency levels required for this pre-feasibility study. Total development capital spending life of mine is $12.4 billion. CAPEX spending for Phase 1 began in 2023 and will continue through 2027 when production begins with one acid plant, the necessary civil works and infrastructure to support Phase 1 production rates. Phase 1 will require $2.9 billion in capital, Phase 2 will require $2.3 billion, Phase 3 will require $2.8 billion, Phase 4 and 5 will require $4.3 billion. $114 million in infrastructure improvements to roads and powerlines complements the development of the phases in years 39 and 40. Sustaining capital and mine capital repayment over the 85-year mine life totals $6.9 billion to support mining, process and acid plants, and storage facility expansions.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Operating Costs</ins>: Cost inputs into the model are from Q1-Q4 2024 and meet the accuracy and contingency levels required for this pre-feasibility study. Since Phase 1 is in construction, at the time of writing, investments in the Project to date beginning in 2023 are amortized in the model. The average unit operating cost per tonne of lithium carbonate produced is expected to be $8,039 for the 85-year LOM (base case) and $6,238 for the 25-year case.</p></li>
<li><p><ins>Economic Results</ins>: Based on Q1-Q4 2024 capital and operating cost pricing, the economic analysis of the Project includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Production of 11.5 Mt of lithium carbonate over a 85-year period.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial capital requirement of $12.4 billion to construct Phases 1-5 over a seventeen-year period.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial capital of $2.9 billion to construction Phase 1 over a 5-year period</p></li>
<li><p>Average annual operating cost per tonne of lithium carbonate over an 85-year period of $8,039.</p></li>
<li><p>Average price per tonne of lithium carbonate over a 85-year period forecasted to be $24,000.</p></li>
<li><p>Average annual EBITDA<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-1" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> over a 85-year period estimated to be $2.1 billion.</p></li>
<li><p>Average annual sustaining capital over a 85-year period of $81.4 million.</p></li>
<li><p>Economic indicators for 85-year base case: $8.7 billion NPV, 20.0% IRR, undiscounted payback period of 8.7 years (on an after-tax basis with an 8% discount rate applied).</p></li>
